+"In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original juridiction.   See Arizona v. California, 589 U. S. ____ (Feb. 24, 2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue."
